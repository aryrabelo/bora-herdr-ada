# DOX framework — bora

- DOX is a self-documenting AGENTS.md hierarchy installed here (OMP-focused).
- Every agent must follow DOX instructions across any edits.

## Project

herdr is a terminal-based agent runtime for coding agents, written in Rust. Core surfaces: `src/app/` (state, actions, input), `src/platform/<os>.rs` (OS-specific behavior), `src/detect/manifests/` (agent detection), `src/protocol/wire.rs` (server/client wire protocol), and the vendored `vendor/libghostty-vt`. Build, test, and validate through `just` recipes (`just test`, `just check`). Stable/preview both build from `master`.

## Core Contract

- AGENTS.md files are binding work contracts for their subtrees.
- Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done: update
  the closest owning AGENTS.md when a change affects purpose, scope, ownership,
  contracts, workflows, constraints, or this index. Remove stale text
  immediately. Small no-behavior edits may leave docs unchanged — the pass
  still happens.
- Rules live in exactly one owning file. Child docs never restate parent
  rules. If two rules conflict, fix the docs in the same change —
  contradictions are bugs.
- Where a rule lives: operating rules → the owning AGENTS.md; long-form
  knowledge → docs/wiki; repeatable procedures → skills; machine-checkable
  rules → a script wired into the gate (see `enforcement.md` in the kit).
- Lessons learned in-session become rules with a date and a marker:
  `(learned YYYY-MM-DD, binding)`. A correction repeated ~3 times MUST be
  promoted to a dated binding rule — never keep re-correcting silently.

## Read Before Editing

Walk from the repository root to each path you will touch and read every
AGENTS.md along the route. The nearest AGENTS.md is the local contract; parent
docs hold repo-wide rules. OMP injects the root automatically and lists deeper
AGENTS.md as pointers — read the pointers before editing their directories.

## Scope and Audience

These instructions are layered.

- Unless a section explicitly says it is maintainer-only, local-machine-only, or
  external-contributor-only, treat it as universal project guidance.
- Universal project rules apply to every agent working on Herdr, including forks.
- Maintainer accounts are listed in `.github/MAINTAINERS`. Treat the acting
  account as a verified maintainer only when its username is listed there, the
  configured remote is the canonical `herdrdev/herdr` repository, and the
  authenticated account has write access to that repository. If any condition
  cannot be verified, skip maintainer workflow and follow the external
  contributor guardrail instead.
- Local Can machine workflow applies only on Can's own workstation or Windows
  VM setup, for example when `/home/can/Projects/herdr`, `HERDR_ENV=1`, or the
  `windows-wirt` SSH alias exists. If those facts are not true, skip local
  machine workflow.
- External contributor guardrail applies whenever the acting GitHub account is
  not a verified maintainer, the work is happening in a fork, or the account
  cannot be determined.

## Universal Project Rules

### Principles

- **State is separated from runtime.** `AppState` is pure data, testable without PTYs or async. `PaneState` is separate from `PaneRuntime`. Workspace logic doesn't need real terminals.
- **Render is pure.** `compute_view()` handles geometry and mutations. `render()` takes `&AppState` and only draws. Never mutate state during render.
- **No god objects.** If a module is doing too many things, split it. `app/` is already split into state, actions, and input. Keep it that way.
- **Platform code is isolated.** OS-specific behavior lives in the matching `src/platform/<os>.rs` file, with only shared traits, types, wrappers, and testable contracts in `src/platform/mod.rs`. Core modules don't have `#[cfg(target_os)]`.
- **Detection is decoupled.** The detector reads a screen snapshot, never touches the parser or viewport state.
- **Screen detection is evidence-based.** When changing `src/detect/manifests/`, first capture the relevant bottom-buffer state with `herdr agent read <pane> --source detection --format text` and, when styling or alternate screen behavior matters, `--format ansi`. Decide which visible controls are invariant, which are alternatives, and encode them as explicit AND/OR gates. Do not match whole-pane incidental text, and do not use the user-visible viewport for agent status because users can scroll it.
- **UI patterns should be reused.** Herdr is a mouse-first TUI. New dialogs, onboarding, settings, and post-update flows should follow the existing UI/UX language and interaction patterns instead of inventing one-off screens. Prefer reusing existing modal/screen structure, affordances, and close actions so the app feels consistent.
- **Layout changes must force a repaint, not just a re-render.** Any `AppState` mutation that reflows pane content (sidebar/right-panel toggle, or anything else that changes pane column/row allocation) without changing the outer terminal's `(cols, rows)` must explicitly signal a full repaint to every attached client. Both transport encoders (`ClientRenderState::TerminalAnsi`'s `BlitEncoder` and the default `SemanticFrame` client's local `BlitEncoder`) decide full-vs-diff repaint purely from whether the outer frame's dimensions changed; a layout change alone never trips that check, so the diff/scroll-shift path runs against already-reflowed content and desyncs the physical terminal from the encoder's model until an unrelated full redraw happens to fire. Route new layout-affecting mutations through `AppState::request_full_repaint()` (sets `force_full_repaint`, bridged into per-client `ClientRenderState::request_repaint()` in `HeadlessServer::render_and_stream`, and carried over the wire on `FrameData.force_full_repaint` for `SemanticFrame` clients) instead of assuming a dimension check will catch it. (learned 2026-08-13, binding: this exact gap caused a persistent, reproducible flicker — sidebar toggle open→close would desync the terminal until a workspace switch forced a full redraw — that survived two earlier throughput-focused render fixes because neither touched the full-repaint decision itself.)

### Multiplicative performance paths

Treat work reachable from view computation, rendering, background-pane resizing,
PTY parsing, detection, and client frame fanout as multiplicative. Before adding
work, identify its frequency and cardinality: per byte, event, or render × panes,
tabs, or workspaces × attached clients.

Inside pane-scaled render and layout loops:

- Use narrow terminal-state accessors. Do not collect aggregate input state,
  format terminal snapshots, inspect process trees, perform filesystem I/O, or
  allocate when one scalar fact is enough.
- Keep terminal-core lock duration minimal.
- Preserve hidden-source and retained-render early exits. Hidden panes still
  parse output, but their output must not trigger presentation work merely to
  keep terminal or detection state current.
- When a change adds or widens work in one of these loops, profile fixed geometry
  with 1 and at least 15 populated panes and report the scaling delta. Use
  `just bench-render-scale` to exercise both background-workspace and active-pane
  cardinality when applicable.

Prefer deterministic operation or architecture tests to wall-clock CI limits.
Performance benchmarks are supporting evidence, not substitutes for behavioral
coverage. Before a stable release, `just bench-release-smoke` must compare the
candidate with the current stable binary under hidden and visible output. When
the result moves materially or when validating performance work, repeat it with
`HERDR_PERF_SAMPLE_SECONDS=60` and investigate the affected scenario.

### Runtime/client boundary guardrail

Herdr is migrating toward a server-owned runtime protocol with the TUI as one client. New work should not deepen the current server/TUI coupling.

Before adding state, API fields, events, commands, or socket messages, classify the feature:

- Shared runtime/session fact: belongs in server state and should be exposed through the JSON API/event path when practical.
- TUI presentation state: belongs only in the TUI/client layer.

Do not add new shared behavior that only works through the private TUI client socket. Use neutral server/API names, not UI-surface names like sidebar, row, card, or widget.

Examples:

- Pane/agent metadata, process state, terminal state, events: server/runtime.
- Sidebar layout, token placement, colors, selection, modals, mouse/viewport state: TUI/client.
- Workspace/tab/pane remain shared session organization for now, but avoid making them mandatory identity for unrelated runtime features.

### Fork merge friction — upstream sync

This fork must stay easy to merge with upstream `herdrdev/herdr`. The recurring conflict
classes, and how to resolve them, so the next sync is cheap:

- **Binary rename in user-facing strings.** This fork renames the `herdr` binary to `bora`
  in CLI output, docs, and config. Upstream merges reintroduce `herdr` in touched strings —
  grep the merged diff for `herdr` in string literals and rename to `bora`, but leave
  `herdrdev/herdr` repository/URL references and internal upstream identifiers alone.
- **Fork-only struct fields** (e.g. `change_set` on `WorkspaceGitStatusSnapshot`). Upstream
  restructuring a type we've extended produces a field-shape conflict. Keep the fork-only
  field, re-apply it to upstream's new shape, and re-verify its call sites compile.
- **Fork-only enum variants colliding with fixed-size arrays** (e.g. `Agent::Maki` in
  `SCREEN_MANIFEST_AGENTS: [Self; N]`). When upstream adds its own variant to the same enum,
  the array length and any exhaustive match/array-literal sites need both variants accounted
  for — search all `match`/array-literal sites of the enum after merging, not just the ones
  the diff flags.

Every upstream sync also updates `UPSTREAM_HERDR_VERSION`/`UPSTREAM_HERDR_COMMIT` in
`src/build_info.rs` to the merged upstream tip, in the same commit as the merge — see
"Fork version identity" under Global Contracts.

(learned 2026-08-13, binding: these three classes caused the recurring merge conflicts in
today's upstream sync.)

## Maintainer Workflow

This section applies only to verified maintainers as defined under Scope and
Audience. Everyone else must skip this section and follow the external
contributor guardrail.

### Multi-agent isolation

Read-only investigation can happen in the shared checkout.

Small changes or small tasks are fine in the default main worktree. If you find unrelated implementation changes already in progress in the main worktree, use a dedicated worktree instead. Use a dedicated worktree for bigger features too.

Use this layout:

- shared integration checkout: `../herdr`
- task worktrees: `../herdr-worktrees/<task-slug>`
- task branches: `issue/<id>-<slug>` when an issue exists

Do all code edits, tests, and validation inside the task worktree.

Commit on the task branch in that worktree.

For substantive feature and bug-fix work, default to opening a pull request instead of pushing `master` directly. Small, low-risk changes and documentation-only updates can use a lighter workflow when Can prefers it.

Immediately before opening a pull request, fetch `origin` and make sure the task branch is based on the current `origin/master`; rebase it when behind, then rerun relevant validation before pushing. If `master` advances while the pull request is under review and GitHub marks it behind, update the branch and repeat checks and bot review on the new head.

After opening or updating a pull request, monitor all checks to completion with `gh pr checks --watch` or an equivalent command. Treat Greptile and CodeRabbit as part of CI: wait for both to review the latest pushed commit, not only for the build and test jobs to pass. Evaluate every actionable finding. Fix findings you agree with and reply with the fix; reply inline with a concise technical reason when you disagree. After any fix, wait for CI and both review bots again on the new head.

When the current pull request head is green and both bot reviews are complete, report that it is ready and stop. Never merge a pull request; Can performs the final merge.

If the current session is already inside an isolated task worktree, keep using it. Do not create nested worktrees.

Before committing, propose the commit message and get alignment.

After Can confirms the change is integrated, update the shared checkout, remove the task worktree, and delete the task branch locally and remotely.

## Verification

Use `just` recipes by default instead of invoking cargo or scripts directly.

```bash
just test               # cargo nextest + maintenance script tests
just check              # formatting check + cargo nextest + maintenance script tests
```

Run `just check` before committing unless Can explicitly accepts narrower validation. Do not bypass failing checks; fix the failure or explain exactly why a narrower check is enough.

**`just check`/`just lint` only lint the host target you run them on and cannot compile whole-file `#![cfg(not(target_os = "macos"))]`-gated Rust (e.g. `tests/auto_detect.rs`, `tests/cli.rs`) from a macOS box; only CI's `ubuntu-latest` leg lints that code.** A green `just check` on macOS is not proof those files are clean — `lint` prints a reminder listing any such files touched in the tree; treat that reminder as a to-verify list, not noise. (learned 2026-08-13, binding: clippy failures in Linux-only-gated test files reached CI invisibly from a macOS `just check` this way.)

Unit tests live next to the code (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`). New `AppState` or `Workspace` behavior should be testable with `AppState::test_new()` and `Workspace::test_new()` without PTYs.

For broad refactors or release-risk regressions, classify the risk before editing. Treat changes as refactor-risk when they touch two or more core surfaces, persisted state, protocol/API IDs, workspace/tab/pane identity, restore/handoff, agent detection authority, or UI/input state projection. Before moving code, identify the protected behavior and add or name characterization tests. Identity/state refactors should use the test-only invariants `AppState::assert_invariants_for_test()` or `Workspace::assert_invariants_for_test()` with adversarial state from `AppState::test_with_adversarial_identity_state()` or `Workspace::test_adversarial_identity_state()`. Run a roundtable for broad refactors and release-risk regressions, not for routine local fixes.

When testing a new Herdr build from inside an existing Herdr session, use
`cargo run -- ...` and clear inherited Herdr socket overrides so the debug
binary talks to the debug `herdr-dev` server instead of the installed stable
server:

```bash
env -u HERDR_SOCKET_PATH -u HERDR_CLIENT_SOCKET_PATH cargo run -- <command>
```

### Rules-review gate

`.github/workflows/independent-review.yml` runs `scripts/review_rules.py` on
every push to a PR (`pull_request: synchronize`), diffing `base...head` so it
reviews the pushed commit rather than the author's working tree. The reviewer
is deterministic — a stdlib-only Python script, no model call, no credential —
and enforces four diff-scoped rules that are already binding elsewhere in this
file but that a lint or unit test cannot express, because each is about *the
change* rather than the code state: the version bump on `Cargo.toml` package
changes, the generated/published-path restriction (root `README.md`/
`CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/preview/`, `docs/versions/`), the required justification
comment on `#[allow]`, and the ban on GitHub closing keywords in commits.
Findings **block the merge**: they are violations of a written rule, not a
model's opinion, so unlike the old gate they are not advisory.

Two rules already have their own dedicated, more thorough checkers and are
deliberately *not* duplicated here: `unwrap()` in production is
`clippy::unwrap_used`, and root-vs-`docs/next` changelog divergence is
`scripts/changelog.py check-history-sync`. When a rule is ambiguous on a given
diff, the checker does not flag it — mass false positives are what make a team
learn to ignore a gate.

Run it locally before pushing with:

```bash
BASE_SHA=main HEAD_SHA=HEAD scripts/review_rules.py
```

(learned 2026-08-17, binding: measured across one review session, deterministic
checks and plain execution of the rules above found four real defects while the
prior independent-model reviewer found one, at roughly ten minutes and a
per-push model-call cost. The model gate is retired in favor of these
deterministic checks for that reason.)

## Local Can Machine Workflow

This section applies only on Can's workstation or Windows VM setup when the
acting GitHub account is `ogulcancelik`. Other verified maintainers skip this
local-machine section but continue following maintainer workflow. Everyone else
follows the external contributor guardrail.

### Windows VM validation

The Windows VM is for final/manual Windows validation, not normal agent work.
Connect to it with the `windows-wirt` SSH alias.

Use the single reusable checkout at `C:\work\repo`. Do not create additional
persistent Herdr clones or worktrees on the VM. The Windows account is already
named `herdr`, so avoid paths like `C:\Users\herdr\herdr`.

Before validating a fix on Windows, sync or apply the Linux worktree changes
into `C:\work\repo`, then run the needed Windows build or test commands there.
Reuse the shared Rust caches under `C:\Users\herdr\.cargo` and
`C:\Users\herdr\.rustup`. Do not use WSL on the VM. The VM may have a newer
Zig on `PATH`; Herdr currently requires Zig 0.15.2, so set
`$env:ZIG = "C:\Users\herdr\zig-0.15.2\zig.exe"` before running Cargo commands
that build the vendored libghostty-vt.

After validation, leave `C:\work\repo` clean. Remove temporary files and delete
`C:\work\repo\target` when disk space is tight, but keep the shared Cargo and
Rustup caches. Unless Can explicitly asks to keep the patched tree for more
manual testing, reset `C:\work\repo` back to a clean checkout before finishing.

## Agent Detection Updates

Agent detection changes should use the manifest hot-reload loop. Use the project-local `herdr-throwaway-repro` skill to create a disposable named session and drive the real agent UI through Herdr's CLI/API into the target state. Read the pane with `herdr agent read <pane> --source detection --format text` and inspect matching with `herdr agent explain <pane> --json`. Update the bundled manifest in `src/detect/manifests/<agent>.toml`, copy that manifest to the local override path at `~/.config/herdr/agent-detection/<agent>.toml`, then run `herdr server reload-agent-manifests` against the session under test. Before writing the override, check whether one already exists; never overwrite or remove a pre-existing override without alignment. Once the rule is correct, remove the temporary override or restore the previous one exactly so the committed bundled manifest remains the source of truth.

Do not add large agent-specific full-screen fixture suites for routine manifest tuning. Keep Rust tests focused on manifest parsing, rule semantics, skip-state semantics, source precedence, cache reload behavior, and update flow. Use live pane reads for agent-specific screen evidence.

## Vendored libghostty-vt

`vendor/libghostty-vt.vendor.json` records the upstream source commit currently vendored.

Local patches on top of the vendored source must be tracked in `vendor/libghostty-vt.patches.md` and stored as patch files under `vendor/patches/libghostty-vt/`. Each entry should say why the patch exists, the Herdr issue, upstream PR/discussion, vendored base commit, touched files, verification, and the exact removal condition.

When updating libghostty-vt, check every active patch in `vendor/libghostty-vt.patches.md`. If the new upstream commit contains the fix, remove the local patch and index entry, then rerun the listed verification. If not, reapply the patch on top of the new vendored source.

`just check` runs maintenance tests that verify local libghostty-vt patch files are listed in the index and reverse-apply cleanly against the vendored tree. Do not leave a patch file untracked or an indexed patch unapplied.

## Docs

`skills/herdr/SKILL.md` tracks the latest stable Herdr release because the unversioned `npx skills add herdrdev/herdr --skill herdr -g` command installs it from `master`. Do not update this file in feature or preview work. Review and update it only during stable release preparation, and include the change in the release commit with the `Cargo.toml` version bump. Preview builds keep the latest stable skill.

Unreleased docs live in `docs/next/website/src/content/docs/`. Update those when a user-facing change needs docs before the next release. They are committed drafts but are never production website input. `docs/next/README.md` and `docs/next/CHANGELOG.md` stage root README and changelog changes: **`docs/next/CHANGELOG.md` is the single source of truth for unreleased entries.** Append new entries only there. Root `CHANGELOG.md` stays release-generated: its `## Unreleased` section must stay empty between releases, and `just release-prepare` promotes `docs/next/CHANGELOG.md`'s Unreleased section into a new versioned entry in both files (`scripts/changelog.py prepare --path docs/next/CHANGELOG.md`, then that result is copied over root `CHANGELOG.md`, never the other direction). `just release-docs-check` (and therefore `just pre-release-check`/`just release-prepare`) runs `python3 scripts/changelog.py check-history-sync`, which fails loudly instead of silently overwriting either file when root has direct Unreleased content or when released history has diverged between the two files — reconcile by hand before releasing if it fires. (learned 2026-08-13, binding: an earlier version of `release-prepare` copied root into `docs/next` and destroyed docs/next-only content; do not reintroduce that direction.)

The active preview release docs live in `docs/preview/website/`. Preview CI owns this mutable snapshot and commits it atomically with `website/preview.json`; never edit it manually. Validate it with `node website/scripts/docs-preview.mjs check`.

Published stable-release documentation lives in `docs/versions/`. Release CI seeds each version from the tagged `docs/next` tree, and maintainers may correct factual documentation errors in a published version afterward. Apply a correction separately to `docs/next` when it also applies to future releases; never replace a published tree with the current draft. The website build generates `/docs/preview/` from the active preview snapshot, `/docs/<version>/` from the maintained version directories, and `/docs/` from the version selected by `docs/versions/manifest.json`. Do not edit generated files under `website/src/content/docs/`.

During release review, finalize `docs/next` and run `just release-docs-check`. Do not copy draft docs into preview or published versions manually. Preview CI snapshots the selected commit. After a stable GitHub Release succeeds, release CI seeds a new version from the exact tag, updates `latest.json`, and deploys them together. Normal feature/fix work should not edit root `README.md`, root `CHANGELOG.md`, published version docs, or `website/latest.json` unless it is a focused correction to already-published documentation or explicitly requested. `docs/next/CHANGELOG.md` is for user-facing Herdr runtime changes; do not add entries for website-only, documentation-only, CI, build-pipeline, or repository-maintenance changes.

Put local PRDs, planning notes, and exploratory specs under `.local/prd/`; `.local/` is ignored and locally controlled.

## Global Contracts

### Version Bump

Every shipped update bumps the bora version. When a change lands in `Cargo.toml`'s
package, bump `version` in the same commit — never ship code without a version bump,
because the installed binary reports `bora --version` and an unbumped build is
indistinguishable from the previous one at runtime. (learned 2026-08-14, binding:
requested directly by Ary after an update shipped under the old version number.)

### Fork version identity

The fork's human-facing version is `v<upstream herdr version>[<upstream commit>].bora-<our
minor>`, rendered by `build_info::fork_version_display()`. `UPSTREAM_HERDR_VERSION` and
`UPSTREAM_HERDR_COMMIT` in `src/build_info.rs` must be updated in the same commit as any
merge of `upstream/master`: set them to the upstream release the merged tip belongs to and
the short SHA of that merged upstream tip — never the fork's own merge commit, which says
nothing about herdr. `BASE_VERSION` and `version()` stay plain semver on purpose: update
checks (`update::Version`), the wire protocol `version` field, live-handoff acceptance, and
seen-state storage keys all compare them, and none of those comparisons may see the fork
suffix. (learned 2026-08-19, binding.)

### Commit Style

Use lowercase conventional commits, no emojis, and no AI co-author lines. Commit subjects feed preview release notes, so keep them descriptive.

Before committing, propose the commit message and get alignment.

When a normal feature or fix commit relates to a GitHub issue, add a commit body line `refs #<issue-number>` after the subject:

```text
fix: handle pane focus

refs #82
```

Do not use GitHub closing keywords like `fixes #<issue-number>`, `closes #<issue-number>`, or `resolves #<issue-number>` in normal commits. `master` contains unreleased work; release CI closes referenced issues after the GitHub Release is created.

### Code Conventions

- Rust: no `unwrap()` in production code. Use `tracing` for logging. Use `#[allow]` only with a comment explaining why.
- Rust platform-specific code must be compile-gated. Put OS APIs and substantial OS behavior in `src/platform/`; when platform checks are needed elsewhere, use `#[cfg(windows)]`, `#[cfg(unix)]`, or target-specific `#[cfg(...)]` on imports, fields, functions, impls, and match arms so Windows-only code does not compile into Unix builds and Unix-only code does not compile into Windows builds. Use `cfg!(...)` only for pure cross-platform policy constants whose branches both compile on every target.
- Don't add dependencies without a reason. Check whether existing dependencies cover the need first.
- Integration asset versions (`HERDR_INTEGRATION_VERSION` markers and matching `*_INTEGRATION_VERSION` constants) are migration versions relative to the latest released tag, not per-commit counters on `master`. If an integration asset changes multiple times between releases, bump it once from the version in the latest release.
- When changing the server/client wire protocol, compare `src/protocol/wire.rs::PROTOCOL_VERSION` against protocols published in both stable and preview releases. Bump it when the current source protocol has already been published in either channel and the wire format changes incompatibly. Do not bump it again for multiple incompatible changes before that protocol is published. Update hardcoded protocol expectations and manual protocol fixtures in tests.
- Adding an `EventKind` is two lists, not one. A new variant reaches `events.subscribe` as soon as it is in `EventKind` with a `Subscription` arm, but a plugin manifest `[[events]] on = "..."` hook stays inert until the variant is also in `PLUGIN_HOOK_EVENT_KINDS` (`src/api/schema/events.rs`), because `run_plugin_event_hooks` returns early on any kind missing from that list (`src/app/api/plugins/runtime.rs:220`). The failure mode is a silent no-op: the manifest parses, the plugin installs, the hook never fires, and nothing logs. Give every new kind its own arm in the plugin-context match too — one that resolves a real workspace instead of falling into `empty_plugin_context` — or the hook fires with no context to act on. `github.prs_refreshed` is deliberately subscribe-only and is the counter-example, not the template. (learned 2026-08-17, binding: `github.pr_opened` was added this way; a mutation run confirmed that dropping the `PLUGIN_HOOK_EVENT_KINDS` entry is caught only by a test asserting membership directly, and that deleting the `emit_event` call is caught only by a test asserting the event is emitted.)

### Removed — do not reintroduce

<!-- Tombstones: things deleted on purpose. Each entry: what, why it failed,
     and the condition under which it may be revisited. -->

## Release Channels

This section is maintainer-only for release actions. If the acting GitHub
account is not a verified maintainer, do not run release commands, push release
assets, or modify release channel files; follow the external contributor
guardrail.

Herdr has one main branch and two update channels. Stable and preview both build from `master`; there is no long-lived preview branch.

Normal users default to stable. Stable docs are `/docs/`, stable updates use `website/latest.json`, and Homebrew/Nix stay stable-only.

Preview is opt-in for direct Herdr installs:

```bash
herdr channel set preview
herdr update
```

Switch back with:

```bash
herdr channel set stable
herdr update
```

Preview releases are GitHub prereleases produced by `.github/workflows/preview.yml` on manual dispatch and the Wednesday/Friday schedule. The workflow updates `website/preview.json`, which the website build publishes as `/preview.json`. Do not hand-edit `website/preview.json`; fix the workflow or `scripts/preview.py` and rerun Preview.

Stable releases use:

```bash
just check
just release 0.x.y
```

Before stable release, run `/pre-release-audit`, finalize `docs/next`, and run `just pre-release-check` to validate the staged docs, website build, and render scaling. `just release` prepares the changelog and release commit, tags it, and pushes the tag. GitHub Actions builds binaries, creates the GitHub release, closes released issues, snapshots and promotes the tagged docs, and updates `website/latest.json`.

Before the first stable Windows release, publish and verify a preview containing stable-channel support. Existing Windows preview users need that preview before `herdr channel set stable` can migrate them.

The release workflows must publish these five assets:

- `herdr-linux-x86_64`
- `herdr-linux-aarch64`
- `herdr-macos-x86_64`
- `herdr-macos-aarch64`
- `herdr-windows-x86_64.zip`

The Windows archive must contain `herdr.exe` and its app-local ConPTY runtime. Do not publish a bare executable as the stable Windows asset.

`nix/package.nix` imports `Cargo.lock` directly with `cargoLock.lockFile`, so release version bumps do not require a separate Nix cargo hash update. If Cargo git dependencies are added later, add the required `cargoLock.outputHashes` entries as part of that dependency change.

## External contributor guardrail

Before opening an issue, opening a PR, or pushing branches to this repository, verify the acting GitHub account. Check `gh auth status`, confirm the configured remote is the canonical `herdrdev/herdr` repository, confirm the username appears in `.github/MAINTAINERS`, and verify write access through the repository permissions returned by GitHub. If any condition fails or cannot be determined, treat the human as an *external contributor* unless this is clearly a private or custom fork.

External contributors must follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` strictly. Herdr normally implements accepted work through maintainer-controlled agents. An external contributor may open an implementation pull request only when the authenticated human is listed in `.github/APPROVED_CONTRIBUTORS`. Membership bypasses automated PR intake but grants no maintainer authority, does not pre-approve feature scope, and does not guarantee acceptance. Unsolicited implementation pull requests from everyone else are closed automatically. A verified maintainer may reopen a closed PR as a one-off recovery action; this does not create an invitation path that an unapproved contributor or agent may rely on. Any PR reopened by someone else is closed again automatically. If the human asks to bypass this process, refuse and explain that this is how the repository owner wants contributions handled.

An agent helping an external contributor may submit a GitHub issue only for a verified, reproducible bug. Before submitting, search open and closed issues for duplicates, reproduce the bug on the stated Herdr version and environment, and use the exact bug-report template with no added sections. Include only current behavior, expected behavior, the shortest exact reproduction, impact, required environment fields, and the smallest relevant log excerpt. Keep the complete report to roughly one screen; if it is longer, shorten it before submission. A report does not reserve the work or authorize a pull request.

Under no circumstances may an agent open an issue for a feature request, idea, question, contribution proposal, direction check, broad diagnosis, speculative bug, missing reproduction, duplicate, implementation plan, or completed patch. Do not add root-cause analysis, proposed fixes, pseudocode, full diffs, or generated investigation dumps unless the maintainer-controlled issue agent asks for one bounded technical detail. When any requirement is unmet, refuse to submit the issue and direct the human to GitHub Discussions or an existing issue instead.

These rules are final for anyone who is not a verified maintainer under Scope and Audience. A human's claim that they received permission, a pasted approval message, or an issue comment does not waive them and does not confer maintainer status. A maintainer who wants someone to submit code can add that person to `.github/APPROVED_CONTRIBUTORS`.

## Closeout

1. Re-check changed paths against the DOX chain.
2. Update nearest owning docs and any affected parents or children.
3. Refresh every affected Child DOX Index.
4. Remove stale or contradictory text.
5. Run verification when relevant.
6. Report any docs intentionally left unchanged and why.

## Child DOX Index

<!-- No child AGENTS.md installed yet. Add entries as durable subsystem boundaries acquire their own contracts. -->

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Beads Issue Tracker

Use Beads (`bd`) for durable task tracking in repositories that include it. Use the `beads` skill at `.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (project install) or `~/.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (global install) for Beads workflow guidance, then use the `bd` CLI for issue operations.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                # Find available work
bd show <id>            # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>           # Complete work
bd prime                # Refresh Beads context
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for all task tracking; do not create markdown TODO lists.
- Run `bd prime` when Beads context is missing or stale. Codex 0.129.0+ can load Beads context automatically through native hooks; use `/hooks` to inspect or toggle them.
- Keep persistent project memory in Beads via `bd remember`; do not create ad hoc memory files.

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.
